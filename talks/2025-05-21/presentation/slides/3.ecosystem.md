# Ecosystem

<!--
Now that we understood the concept of MCP, let's look at some examples.
Since use cases are diverse, after all, MCP servers expose various functionalities, I've selected a few of them to demonstrate their potential, like a showcase.

There are many more out there, I've just picked a few to show you what's possible

# Ecosystem Growth

- Rapid growth in the number of companies and community projects
- Companies like **OpenAI**, **Microsoft**, **Github**, **Stripe**, **Cloudflare**, etc. joined the ecosystem
- [Native Microsoft MCP support](https://x.com/TeksEdge/status/1924513285636030845), [ChatGPT MCP support](https://x.com/btibor91/status/1922431656067268876), [Gemini GPT support](https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1910206107114418539)
- By February 2025, there were over 1,000 community-built MCP servers available now more than 5,000
- **A2A** Integration



<!--
Major companies like Stripe, GitHub, and Cloudflare are creating their own MCP servers. The community has created a lot of open source projects.

A big future possibility is working with Google's A2A. MCP could handle tools while A2A manages AI agents working together. This combination could be very powerful, but we'll discuss this later.

<!-- 
Have you ever asked Claude to solve a problem or implement a library feature, and received a response with fake methods or parameters from an outdated version?

Well, context7 is both an MCP server and web service that collects documentation from popular JavaScript libraries, creating a vector database and providing a service to search for relevant library documentation based on your query.

The service then exposes a markdown file called llms.txt that LLMs can read and interpret.

It's more powerful than a simple search engine, because it can understand the context and the library version.

Run Node.js Scripts: Execute JavaScript files with full support for command-line arguments and standard input

Execute npm Scripts: Run commands defined in your project's package.json

Evaluate JavaScript Code: Test code snippets directly without creating separate files

Node.js Version Management: Switch between different Node.js versions via NVM integration

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:

Run Node.js scripts: "Could you run my analysis.js script with the data.json file as an argument?"

Execute npm commands: "Please run the 'build' script in my project"

Evaluate JavaScript code: "Can you test this function for me with different inputs?"

Switch Node.js versions: "Switch to Node.js v18 and run the compatibility test"

# MCP-server: [`mcp-markitdown`](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp)

Convert a resource described by an http:, https:, file: or data: URI to markdown


`convert_to_markdown` tool supports the following file types:

- **pptx**  PowerPoint files
- **docx**  Word files
- **xlsx**  Excel files
- **xls**  older Excel files
- **pdf**  PDF files
- **outlook**  Outlook messages
- **az-doc-intel**  Azure Document Intelligence
- **audio-transcription**  audio transcription of wav and mp3 files
- **youtube-transcription**  fetching YouTube video transcription
- many other file types...


<!-- 
Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively "speak" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient.
