### **A2A Agent to Agent communication**

- A2A allows agents to communicate, discover each other's capabilities, negotiate tasks, and collaborate even if built on different platforms.

- The protocol enables long-running tasks, multimodal interactions, and secure auth. Agents exchange capabilities via JSON cards and sync states in real-time.

**Real Use case example**

> In hiring, one agent might source candidates, another handles scheduling, and another does background checks all within the same agentic interface (e.g., Agentspace).

<!--
A2A is a protocol for agent-agent collaboration, basically it's a protocol for agent to agent communication. it's better to understand if we show an example.
Google is creating a marketplace for A2A agents. Each agent can use one or more tools, with or without MCP

# MCP and A2A Comparison


- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for tools and resources

  - Connect agents to tools, APIs, and resources with structured inputs/outputs.
  - Google ADK supports MCP tools. Enabling wide range of MCP servers to be used with agents.

- **A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol)** for agent-agent collaboration
  - Dynamic, multimodal communication between different agents without sharing memory, resources, and tools
  - Open standard driven by community.
  - Samples available using Google ADK, LangGraph

# Impact on Agentic AI for tech users

- **Natural language commands** for Git, CI/CD, project management
- **AI IDE integration** for streamlined coding tasks using "chain of tools"
- **Reduced context switching** between tools, faster problem resolution

<!--
With tools like playwright-mcp we can test a bug. With tools like context7-mcp we can use the updated context for a specific library. Ideally is not usefull a single tool but a chain of tools.

# Impact on Agentic AI for non-tech users

- **Natural language interfaces** for everyday tasks
- **Simplified interaction** with complex systems
- **Reduced technical knowledge** requirements

<!--
 Democratized Technology Access

For non-technical users, AI through MCP represents a significant democratization of technology. But at the moment the MCP ecosystem is not yet mature and the tools are not yet ready for the mass market.
Google will release AgentSpace a marketplace for A2A agents.

# Future??


- Major AI companies are driving platforms toward AI-native interfaces, eliminating the need for traditional frontends. 
- Data and system integration will become crucial as LLMs and agents leverage tools to interact with information in personalized ways.

1. **Traditional APIs**

   - API design for a frontend

2. **AI APIs / MCP / A2A / ..?**
   - API designed for AI

<!--
Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc. are working on make our platform more and more AI native, without the need of a frontend for every application, but the Data and the system integration will become more important, because we will probably use and develope "tools" and LLM and Agent will be able to use them, chosing different personalized way to view and interact with the data.
